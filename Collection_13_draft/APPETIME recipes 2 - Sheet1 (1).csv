In a medium bowl, whisk the all-purpose flour, salt and baking soda to combine.
Using a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the vegan butter or margarine, cane sugar and coconut sugar on medium speed until very light, 3 to 4 minutes.
In a small bowl, whisk the flaxseed with 2 tablespoons room temperature water to combine. Add this mixture to the mixer and mix well on medium speed to combine. Scrape the bowl well, then add the vanilla and mix to combine.
Add the dry ingredients and mix on low speed until just combined, 5 to 10 seconds. Scrape the bowl well and mix on low speed to ensure the mixture is homogenous.
Add the chocolate and mix just until incorporated. Scoop the dough into 8 (3 1/2 ounce/100 gram) mounds of dough the size of generous golf balls, and transfer them to the prepared baking sheets. Stagger the rows to allow the cookies room to spread.
Gently press the mounded cookies down slightly using your fingers until about 1/2-inch thick. Sprinkle lightly with sea salt, if using. Bake the cookies, switching racks and rotating the sheets halfway through, until they’re golden brown around the edges and just barely set in the center, 18 to 21 minutes.

25 vanilla wafer cookies (about 85 grams), broken into coarse pieces","In a large bowl, use a large fork or a potato masher to mash the bananas well. Add the condensed milk and mash again until the two are well combined. The mixture should be fairly smooth and only slightly lumpy.
Using a silicone spatula, stir in the vanilla, cinnamon and salt. Set aside.
In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whip attachment or a handheld mixer, whip the heavy cream to medium peaks. Add about 1/4 of the whipped cream to the banana mixture and stir with the spatula to fully combine. (This lightens the mixture, making it easier to fold in the remaining whipped cream without losing too much aeration.)
Add the remaining whipped cream in 2 to 3 additions, folding gently just to combine. Add all but 3 tablespoons of the crumbled wafer cookies to the mixture and gently fold them in until incorporated.
Pour the mixture into a 9-by-9-inch pan and spread into an even layer. Sprinkle the reserved vanilla wafers evenly on top. Cover the ice cream with plastic wrap, gently pressing the wrap into the surface of the ice cream, and transfer to the freezer.

6 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons/90 grams extra-virgin coconut oil
2 tablespoons/28 grams dark brown sugar
1 teaspoon/5 grams plus a pinch kosher salt
¾ cup/150 grams granulated sugar
½ cup/80 grams cocoa butter, available at baking supply stores and online
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons/266 milliliters coconut milk
½ cup/65 grams chopped walnuts, toasted (optional)","To make the cashew milk, place the cashews in a large bowl and add water to cover by a couple of inches. Soak cashews overnight.
In the morning, drain the cashews and place them in a blender with about 1 3/4 cups (375 grams) fresh water. Blend until smooth. If you use a Vitamix, there will be no need to strain – the milk will be perfectly smooth; for other blenders, check the consistency and, if necessary, strain the cashew milk through a fine-mesh strainer. Cashew milk will keep well, covered and refrigerated, for up to 4 days.
To roast the bananas, heat the oven to 400 degrees with a rack in the middle. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl, toss the bananas, 2 tablespoons/27 grams coconut oil, brown sugar and pinch of salt. Spread on prepared baking sheet and bake until caramelized, about 15 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely.
Put 1/4 cup water into a small saucepan over medium to low heat. Add sugar and cook, stirring frequently, until sugar has dissolved. Add cocoa butter, remaining 4 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons/63 grams coconut oil and remaining salt. Stir until melted.
Pour the sugar mixture into in a food processor (or use a tall 2-quart container and an immersion blender), and add the coconut milk and 1 cup/212 grams cashew milk. Blend until smooth. Add roasted bananas and blend again to combine until very smooth. Cover and refrigerate the ice cream base until chilled, 1 to 2 hours.
Freeze in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In the last minute of churning, add toasted walnuts, if desired, and churn until incorporated. Transfer the ice cream to a storage container and freeze up to 7 days. Alternatively, you can serve it immediately. It will be the consistency of soft-serve.",https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017568-vegan-roasted-banana-ice-cream?action=click&module=Collection%20Page%20Recipe%20Card&region=Vegan%20Dessert%20Recipes&pgType=collection&rank=3

Shape the dough into a 12-inch circle and place into a lightly greased glass or ceramic pie pan. Crimp the edges at the top of the pan. Prick the bottom and sides of the pie crust lightly with a fork so the crust will not puff up and let the liquid from the pie filling go under it.

While the crust chills, combine the apples, 1/3 cup of the apple juice and the raisins and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer 15 minutes. Mix in the cinnamon and lemon juice.
